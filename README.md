## WHAT IS ADVENT OF CODE?

	Advent of Code is a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of 
	skill levels. They are self-contained and are just as appropriate for an 
	expert who wants to stay sharp as they are for a beginner who is just 
	learning to code. Each puzzle calls upon different skills and has two parts 
	that build on a theme.
